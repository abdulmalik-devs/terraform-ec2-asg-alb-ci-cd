# Provisioning of Two EC2 Instances, AWS Load balancer and ASG using Terraform and Performing CI/CD with GitHub Action.

TThis project uses Terraform to provision an AWS Load Balancer and ASG, with Two EC2 Instances and perform CI/CD with GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of the infrastructure.

N.B: The infrastructure can be deployed to multiple environments (e.g. dev, stage, prod) by using different Terraform workspaces.

## Pre-requisites

- An AWS account.
- Terraform CLI installed.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with access,secret keys and Git Token.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/abdulmalik-devs/terraform-ec2-ci-cd.git

2. Check the code and change the neccessary configuration to suite your deployement

3. Initialize the Terraform project:

>terraform init

4. Preview and verify the changes before you apply :

>terraform plan

5. Apply the changes to create the resources:

>terraform apply

6. When you're finished with the resources, destroy them:

>terraform destroy

## Variables

Createt The following variables in your `Github Secrets` file:

| Variable   | Description                                      | Type   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| access_key | AWS access key                                   | string |
| secret_key | AWS secret key                                   | string |
| git_token  | Git Token to gain access and permissions         | token  |

## GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions to perform CI/Cd and automate the deployment of the infrastructure. There are four jobs defined in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file:

1. **lint:** This job format the Terraform code to standard.

2. **terraform-plan-dev-branch:** This job runs `terraform init` and `terraform plan` when a push is made to the `dev-branch` branch. This job will only plan changes, it will not apply them.

3. **terraform-apply-main:** This job runs `terraform apply` when a pull request is closed and merged to the `main` branch. This job will apply the changes.

4. **terraform-destroy-ops-branch:** This job runs `terraform destroy` when a pull request is closed and merged to the `ops-branch` branch. This job will destroy the infrastructure.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision an AWS Load Balancer, ASG and Two EC2 Instances, and how use CI/CD Tool like Github Action to automate the deployment of the infrastructure. Feel free to customize the code and workflows to fit your needs.
